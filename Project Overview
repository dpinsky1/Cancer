Project Title: CO2 Analysis by country

Team Members: David Pinsky, Nathan-Andrew Tompkins, Martin Bedino, Nathaniel Mizzel

Project: Analyze the CO2 emissions across numerous countries, their methods of release against the population sizes, emissions vs. temperatures, rice cultivation emissions vs yield, rural vs urban CO2 emissions, etc.

Research Questions to Answer: 

How much, on average, do urban cities emit CO2 more than rural areas?
What is the total emission per country? 
Nathan-Andrew: How did the CO2 emissions change as the forest land changed over the 20 years?
Nathaniel: How did the CO2 levels / temperatures change with population changes?
Does a forest land decrease mean an increase in population?
David: Is there a relationship between CO2 Emissions and rice yield?
Martin: Analyze male/female population split vs emissions?
