# Emissions_Analysis
Clean Data located in emissions_analysis.ipynb
## Summary
Exploring FAO and IPCC data along with crop yield data to gain insight into deforestation and its effect on emissions and other relevant insights.

## Outline

1. Global Rice Production and the Emissions it Causes\
1a. Posing the Problem - Rice production accounts for 10% of global methane emissions.\
1b. Visaulizing the Problem - Looking at Rice Yields Vs. Emissions globally\
1c. Narrowing the search - zeroing in on region with the highest emissions.\
1d. Finding the Culprits - looking closely at specific countries that are the biggest methane emitters.\
1e. Findings - Potential reasons for the problem and how it is being addressed. 

2. Emissions and Population\
2a. Total population vs. Total Emissions\
2b. Male population vs. Total Emissions\
2c. Female population vs. Total Emissions\
2d. ANOVA Analysis of mean population

3. Farming Emissions vs. Temperature\
3a. Sources of Emissions in Agriculture\
3b. Regional Emissions and Temperature over time.\
3c. Emissions vs. Temperature by region.\
3d. Statistical Analysis

4. Food Retail Emissions vs Population
4a. Question: Does the percentage of CO2 Emissions increase as the urban population increases?
4b. Sub-Regions with notable results
4c. Linear Regressions where they may be found
4d. Conclusion
